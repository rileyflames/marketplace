# Community Marketplace Platform

A **community-driven marketplace** inspired by Carbonite, combining **trusted peer-to-peer listings** with **social features** (comments, ratings, badges, and direct messaging). The platform prioritizes **trust, transparency, and safety**, while minimizing legal liability by **not handling payments directly**.

---

## Vision

Create a **marketplace + community hybrid** where buyers and sellers:

- Can **list items** for sale with **location-based search** (meet-ups or shipping).
- Build **trust** through ratings, badges, and complaint moderation.
- Use **direct messaging** for negotiation without platform-managed escrow.
- Are guided by **warranty options** and **community-driven trust signals** (e.g., new seller warnings, complaint thresholds).

The platformâ€™s role is to **enforce order and transparency** rather than act as a payment intermediary.

- Pages: Home, Listings, Profile, Dashboard, Messaging, Admin
- State management: Context API or Redux Toolkit
- API data fetching: React Query (caching + revalidation)
